### Question 1:

### Question 2:

### Question 3:
Learning-based testing is a strategy that relies on machine learning to identify and predict potential bugs.
Therefore it has a few problems finding bugs in the following categories:
####- Non-deterministic bugs:

## Practical Notes

### Task 1

#### Correct Vending Machine: xy
Briefly describe its behaviour.

#### For each faulty vending machine, describe the fault

### Task 3

#### Describe the bugs for each implementation. Add a shortest test-case that reproduces the bug
